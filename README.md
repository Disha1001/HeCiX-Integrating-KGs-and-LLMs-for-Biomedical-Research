# HeCiX-Integrating-KGs-and-LLMs-for-Biomedical-Research
HeCiXKG, Hetionet-Clinicaltrials neXus Knowledge Graph, a novel fusion of
data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet in a single knowledge graph.
HeCiX-KG combines data on previously conducted clinical trials from
ClinicalTrials.gov, and domain expertise on diseases and genes from Hetionet. Further, we
introduce HeCiX, a system that uses LangChain to integrate HeCiX-KG
with GPT-4, and increase its usability.
